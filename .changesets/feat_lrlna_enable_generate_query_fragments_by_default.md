### Compress subgraph operations by generating fragments ([PR #6013](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6013))

The router now compresses operations sent to subgraphs by default by generating fragment
definitions and using them in the operation.

This change enables `generate_query_fragments` by default while disabling `experimental_reuse_query_fragments`. When enabled, `experimental_reuse_query_fragments` attempts to intelligently reuse the fragment definitions
from the original operation. However, fragment generation with `generate_query_fragments` is much faster also produces better outputs in most cases.

If you are relying on the shape of fragments in your subgraph operations or tests, you can opt out of the new algorithm with the configuration below. 

> Note: The subgraph operations generated by the query planner are not guaranteed consistent release over release. We strongly recommend against relying on the shape of planned subgraph operations, as new router features and optimizations will continuously affect it. We plan to remove `experimental_reuse_query_fragments` in a future release.

```yaml
supergraph:
  generate_query_fragments: false
  experimental_reuse_query_fragments: true
```
